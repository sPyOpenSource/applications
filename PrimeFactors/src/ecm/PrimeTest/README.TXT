Primelity Test: LucasLehmer and ApartCle

Lucas-Lehmer is a primality test for Mersenne numbers, which are numbers of the form 2^p - 1, where p is a prime number.
The test works by defining a sequence of numbers and checking if the last term of the sequence is divisible by the Mersenne number.
The test is fast and simple, but only works for a special class of numbers.

APR-CL stands for Adleman-Pomerance-Rumely-Cohen-Lenstra, which is a primality test for any natural number.  
The test works by using cyclotomic polynomials and modular arithmetic to check if the number satisfies certain properties that only 
prime numbers have. The test is general and rigorous, but also complex and slower than other tests.
