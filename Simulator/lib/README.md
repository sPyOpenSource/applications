# ARM-core

A *very* small ARM9 simulator project written in Java. 

## Why? 

Why not! It is fun to emulate something in any language, if speed isn't a
real deal.

## Status

It does something, but is nowhere finished...

## License

None yet, consider it publicware.

## Author

Code written by J.W. Janssen. Inspired on code of waninkoko, see
